File Details & Methodology:

1) The source videos were converted from a high-speed .cine format to .mp4 for processing in Python.

2) A static Region of Interest (ROI) mask was applied to each frame to focus only on the "pipe" area and eliminate all external background noise.

3) OpenCV's MOG2 algorithm was used for background subtraction to separate the moving flame from the static elements inside the pipe.

4) The resulting mask is applied to the original video frames to produce an output video that preserves the flame's natural shape, color, and saturation.
